# Total Inversion Count

The project calculates the total inversion count of array using two different approaches: <br>
1. Brute Force Approach
2. Merge Sort Approach

- Modify the array 'a' in inversion_count.py to test different cases.
- The merging step does not actually merge and sort the array, as the problem statement only requires counting inversions.
